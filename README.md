# ESBMC-Web - ESBMC Code Analyzer

ESBMC-Web is a comprehensive, web-based graphical user interface (GUI) for the ESBMC model checker. It allows users to write, upload, and analyze C, C++, or Python code directly in the browser.

The tool provides a user-friendly way to select various ESBMC analysis flags and parameters. Results are presented in two formats:

Raw Text Output: The complete, unfiltered console log from the ESBMC tool.

Dashboard View: A rich, interactive dashboard that visualizes violations, counterexamples, and execution traces, making it easier to debug failed verifications.

Features
In-Browser Code Editor: A full-featured editor (powered by CodeMirror) with syntax highlighting for C, C++, and Python.

File Support: Upload the main code file and add multiple dependency files (e.g., .h, .c, .cpp) for C/C++ projects.

Comprehensive Flag Selection: A user-friendly interface to select dozens of ESBMC flags and parameters, including:

Standard Checks: memory-leak-check, overflow-check, data-races-check, etc.

Analysis Algorithms: incremental-bmc, k-induction, falsification, termination.

Property Checking: Granular control to disable assertions, bounds checks, pointer checks, and more.

Parameters: Set unwind, timeout, function, and context-bound.

SMT Solvers: Easily switch between Boolector (default), Z3, CVC5, Bitwuzla, and others.

Dual Result View: Toggle between the raw text log and the interactive dashboard.

Interactive Dashboard: When a violation is found, the dashboard clearly displays:

A clear "VERIFICATION FAILED" status.

Summary cards for total steps and violations.

A detailed table of all violations (file, function, line, and message).

The Counterexample (initial variable values) that triggered the failure.

The complete Execution Trace leading to the violation.

The Analyzed Source Code with the specific lines causing violations highlighted in red.


## Architecture (Simplified)

The project is divided into two parts:

/backend: A Flask (Python) server that receives the code and executes ESBMC.

/frontend: A static HTML/JS page that serves as the user interface.

## Arquitetura (Fluxo de Dados)

    end
    
    A -- "1. Sends (Code + Flags) via API" --> B;

    C -- "3. Returns Report (JSON/Text)" --> B;

## Architecture (Sequence of Events)

    participant Backend_App as "Backend (app.py)"
    participant ESBMC as ESBMC
    participant Dashboard as "Dashboard (script.js)"

    User->>Frontend: 1. Inserts Code, Selects Flags, Clicks "Analyze"
    activate Frontend
    Frontend->>Backend_App: 2. POST /analyze (Code + Flags)
    deactivate Frontend
    activate Backend_App
    Backend_App->>ESBMC: 3. Executes ESBMC with code.c and flags
    activate ESBMC
    ESBMC-->>Backend_App: 4. Returns ESBMC Output (JSON + Text)
    deactivate ESBMC

        Backend_App->>Dashboard: 5a. Returns JSON (SUCCESS)
        activate Dashboard
        Dashboard->>User: 6a. Displays SUCCESS Result on UI
        deactivate Dashboard
    else Analysis Failed / Violation
        Backend_App->>Dashboard: 5b. Returns JSON (ERROR / VIOLATION)
        activate Dashboard
        Dashboard->>User: 6b. Displays ERROR / VIOLATION (Counter-example) on UI
        deactivate Dashboard
    end
    deactivate Backend_App
```

## Setup and Installation

1. Prerequisites:

Python 3.x

ESBMC: The ESBMC binary must be installed and available in your system's PATH. The backend server directly calls the esbmc command.

2. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/esbmc/esbmc-web.git](https://github.com/esbmc/esbmc-web.git)
    cd esbmc-web
    ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # No Linux/macOS
    # ou
    .\venv\Scripts\activate   # No Windows
    ```

4. Install the Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Start the backend server:

    ```bash
    python backend/app.py
    ```

The server will start on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

2. Open the frontend: Open the index.html file directly in your web browser.
